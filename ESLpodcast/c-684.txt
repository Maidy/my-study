What's the lowdown on the new guy?

Which new guy?

You know, the cute one. Feel me in.  Is he single?

I don't know. I have no idea.

You're working with him side-by-side and you haven't gleaned any personal information about him?

We talk about work. It's not my job to pry into his personal life.

I need to get the scoop on Mr. Perfect and you're my source.

You don't know anything about him, so how do you know he is perfect? Maybe when you get to know him, you will find out he is a selfish, self-centered jerk.

Wait, catch me up on what's going on here. Have other people asked you about him?

Yeah, maybe about a dozen of the women in this office. They've been bombarding me with questions.

Oh, sorry. I didn't know.

Yeah, I'm not the guy's social secretary. You women have to satisfy your own curiosity elsewhere.

Point taken, but do you know if he's shown interest in any of the dozen women you've talked to?

Ugh!
